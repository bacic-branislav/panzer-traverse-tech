      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Panzer Controls was born from a passion for both military history and gaming. Our founder, an avid tank enthusiast and 3D designer, noticed a gap in the market for unique gaming peripherals that combine historical elements with practical functionality.</p>
      <p>Starting in 2023, we began designing controller models based on iconic World War II tanks. Each design carefully incorporates distinctive elements from these legendary vehicles, from the imposing Tiger I to the reliable Sherman and the revolutionary T-34.</p>
      <p>Today, we offer a growing collection of high-quality 3D printable controller designs that allow gamers and history buffs alike to hold a piece of military history in their hands while enjoying their favorite games.</p>

      <h2>Our Design Process</h2>
      <p>1. Historical Research</p>
      <p>Each controller begins with extensive research into the tank that will inspire it. We study technical specifications, historical photographs, and even visit museums when possible to ensure our designs capture the essence of these machines.</p>
      <p>2. Conceptualization</p>
      <p>We identify the most distinctive features of each tank and determine how to incorporate them into a controller design that remains comfortable and functional for gaming.</p>
      <p>3. 3D Modeling</p>
      <p>Our designers create detailed 3D models, carefully balancing historical accuracy with ergonomic requirements. Each button, grip, and surface is considered in relation to the tank's design elements.</p>
      <p>4. Testing & Refinement</p>
      <p>We print prototypes and test them extensively for both aesthetic appeal and practical usability. Designs are refined based on this testing until we achieve the perfect balance.</p>
